The semantic patches in this folder are meant to be used for Firehose
export.

Firehose is an XML grammar whose intent is to have a common format for
many static analysis tools.
You can find more information about Firehose at:
https://github.com/fedora-static-analysis/firehose

In order to get a Firehose-compatible output, these patches use the
Coccinelle module xml_firehose, which is located in python/coccilib/.

If you want to use it, you have to pass the option "-D firehose " to
spatch.
